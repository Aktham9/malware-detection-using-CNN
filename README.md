Malware vs. Goodware Classification Using Deep Learning
## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of software files as either "Malware" (MW) or "Goodware" (GW). By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and residual blocks, the model identifies patterns in the images that differentiate malicious software from benign software.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
TensorFlow/Keras
Matplotlib for visualization
PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image handling
Tools:
VisualKeras for model visualization
GitHub for version control
Jupyter Notebook for code execution
## Dataset
Source: Custom dataset of malware and goodware images.
Classes: The dataset is divided into two classes:
MW: Malware images
GW: Goodware images
Image Formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png
Image Dimensions: All images are resized to 256x256 pixels for consistent input to the CNN.
## Project Goals
Build a CNN model capable of classifying images as either malware or goodware.
Train and optimize the model for high accuracy and low error on both training and validation datasets.
Evaluate the model's performance on unseen test data and measure its real-world effectiveness.
## Model Architecture
The model consists of the following:

Input Layer: Accepts 256x256 RGB images.
Initial Convolutional Layer: Uses 8 filters and a kernel size of 3x3.
Residual Blocks: A series of convolutional layers with residual connections to ensure that gradients flow more effectively during backpropagation.
Fully Connected Layers: After flattening the features, the model includes three dense layers of 512, 256, and 128 neurons, each followed by ReLU activation and dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, making it suitable for binary classification (malware vs. goodware).
## Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow matplotlib pillow visualkeras
Cloning the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Aktham9/malware-vs-goodware-classification.git
cd malware-vs-goodware-classification
Running the Project
Ensure that the dataset is available in the ./Data directory with subfolders MW (Malware) and GW (Goodware).
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model:
bash
Copy code
python malware_classification.py
## Training Process
Optimizer: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy for binary classification tasks.
Training: The model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 8, using 90% of the dataset for training and 10% for validation.
Data Augmentation: Considered in future iterations for improved generalization.
Performance
After 20 epochs, the model achieved the following results:

Training Accuracy: X%
Validation Accuracy: Y%
Test Accuracy: Z%
Training and Validation Curves
The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's learning process. These plots help to identify overfitting or underfitting and assess whether the model generalizes well to unseen data.



## Testing and Evaluation
The model was tested on a shuffled subset of 1000 malware and goodware images. It achieved an accuracy of Z% on the test data, which indicates its effectiveness in distinguishing between the two classes.

Test Results:
Correct Predictions (Malware): XX
Correct Predictions (Goodware): YY
Incorrect Predictions: ZZ
## Challenges
Imbalanced Data: The dataset contains fewer malware images compared to goodware, which led to potential bias. Techniques like oversampling and data augmentation will be explored in future iterations.
Overfitting: Managing overfitting was crucial. Dropout layers were added to the dense layers, and validation data was used to monitor model performance.
## Future Work
Data Augmentation: Apply transformations such as rotations, scaling, and flips to increase the size of the training set and enhance model robustness.
Transfer Learning: Explore transfer learning techniques using pretrained models like ResNet or VGG for potentially higher accuracy.
Deployment: Deploy the model as a web service or API to classify new files in real-time.
